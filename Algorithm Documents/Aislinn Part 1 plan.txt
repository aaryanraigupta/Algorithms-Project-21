  
PROBLEM: Finding shortest paths between 2 bus stops (as input by the user), returning the list of stops
en route as well as the associated “cost”. 

1). Get user input to input the stop IDs of the two stop they want the shortest distance between

2). If input incorrect stop ID return an error and restart the program.

3). Potentially display all of the stops when the program begins so that a user can choose
from that list

4). Use transfers.txt to access the directed edges between the two inputted stops.

5). Use stop_times.txt to add the cost between the two stops - (uses the same trip_id).
